# js-tokens-to-scss

This package is a POC of converting JS-based Design Tokens into a SCSS file that displays the values of the tokens as SASS vars.


# Todo

1. Need to look at namespacing vars:

eg. $primary is too vague in a SCSS context; probably need $ads-primary

2. Dictionary - figure out a good workflow

3. Other tokens
- [ ] Colors
- [ ] Fonts
- [ ] FontSizes
- [ ] FontWeights
- [ ] LetterSpacings
- [ ] Radii
- [ ] SpaceScale
